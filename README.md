# Wind Power Energy Prediction

## Description
**Wind Power Energy Prediction** is a web-based application designed to forecast the potential energy output of wind power at various locations. By leveraging data on wind speeds and environmental conditions, the application helps users assess the viability of wind power generation in different areas. The project is built with modern web development technologies, ensuring a smooth user experience and accurate predictions.

## Features
- **Location-Based Prediction**: Allows users to predict wind power energy output based on specific geographic locations.
- **Manual Data Input**: Users can manually input wind speed and other parameters to get an energy output prediction.
- **Comparison Tool**: Enables users to compare the potential energy outputs across multiple locations.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring it works seamlessly across various devices.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: A clean and user-friendly interface that simplifies the prediction process for users.

## Technology Stack
The project uses the following technologies:

- **Frontend**:
  - **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring dynamic and responsive interactions.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing the application's UI.
  - **Vite**: A frontend build tool that provides fast and lean development experience.

- **Backend**:
  - **Node.js**: Handles server-side logic and API interactions.
  - **Express.js**: Manages routing and HTTP requests on the server.

- **Deployment**:
  - **Vercel** or **Netlify**: For deploying the web application.
 
## How It Works
1. **Location-Based Prediction**: Users can select or input a location to see the predicted wind energy output based on historical data and environmental factors.
2. **Manual Input Prediction**: Users can manually input wind speed and other environmental conditions to receive a prediction of wind energy output.
3. **Comparison Feature**: The application allows users to compare the predicted outputs for multiple locations, helping them make informed decisions about wind power viability.

## Future Enhancements
1. Integration with Real-Time Data: Incorporate real-time weather and wind speed data for more accurate and up-to-date predictions.
2. Machine Learning Models: Implement machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of predictions based on historical data.
3. Data Visualization: Add advanced data visualization tools to better illustrate wind power potential across different regions.
